# Dynamic Array in C

## Overview
This project provides a simple implementation of a dynamic array in C that can be used for any type of object. It uses macros and `void*` pointers to achieve genericity.

## Features
- Dynamic resizing: Array automatically resizes itself when capacity is reached.
- Generic type: Supports storing elements of any data type using `void*` pointers.
- Memory management: Provides functions for initialization, insertion, retrieval, and destruction of the array.

## Usage
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dynamic-array-c.git
